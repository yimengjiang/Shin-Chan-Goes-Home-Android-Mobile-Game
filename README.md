# Shin-Chan-Goes-Home-Android-Mobile-Game
I directed a five-person development team to successfully deliver a game suite inspired by the classic Frogger game, implemented in Android Studio using object-oriented analysis and design, XML, and Java. I utilized UML diagrams to document the detailed design of the mobile application and thoroughly documented client functional and non-functional requirements to create a comprehensive design document. I actively contributed to project management by taking the initiative in sprint planning, meeting scheduling, and tracking team progress using Agile methodology, fostering a collaborative team environment throughout the development process.
